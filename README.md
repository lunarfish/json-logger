# Logger

This module provides a JSON based log formatter.

Log writes are augmented with information about the file,
line number etc and you can make conventional placeholdered
format string log writes or log complex data from a dictionary.

The goal is to be able to target components of log messages in
splunk searches.

So instead of `"user firstname.surname logged in at 18:00"` you
have an event like:

```
{
    "user": "firstname.surname",
    "action": "login", 
    "timestamp": "2020-11-18 18:00:00"
}
```  

So you can easily search for all `action=login` events or all
activity by a given user ...

Because you've always got the reference back to where the
event was created in the source code it's easy to debug and
easy to find log writes to enrich if you need more detail.
